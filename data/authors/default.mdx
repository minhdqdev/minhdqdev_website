## Hi there 👋
My name is Minh. I've just graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) with an engineer's degree in August 2022. I find building large distributed systems super fascinating. Though I'm still early in my career, I always try to keep an open mindset to learn new skills. My short-term goal is to become a senior software engineer 👨‍💻.
